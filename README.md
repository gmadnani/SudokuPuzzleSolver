## General info

The Sudoku Solver program is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using a recursive backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle where a 9x9 grid must be filled with digits from 1 to 9 according to specific rules. The program takes Sudoku puzzles as input, represented as a 9x9 grid in a text file, and outputs the solved puzzle.

Sudoku Solver program combines algorithmic problem-solving with practical file input handling to automate the solution of Sudoku puzzles. It is a useful tool for Sudoku enthusiasts, educators, and anyone interested in exploring backtracking algorithms in a real-world context.
